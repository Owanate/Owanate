* 🚀 I'm currently working on **Problem solving** and **Web Frameworks for Front-end development**.
* 🧠 I'm learning to build **accessible apps** that take **users privacy** into consideration while making sure the **feel secure using my apps**.
* 💬 Ask me about **Accessibility**, **Performance**, **Security**, **Privacy** and **Design Systems**.
* 🚀 I'm on track for learning more about **Systems Design**, **Software Design & Architecture** and **Software Testing**
* 📝 I regularly write articles on [*Hashnode*]()
* 🤝 I'm open to collaborating on interesting projects as soon as I'm confident enough in my abilities.
* ⚡ If I could learn and read at a faster rate than I did now, I'll probably be too smart for my own good😎.

#### Want to Build Your Own?

Do you like my profile and want to build your own? It's very simple. GitHub recently added a new feature called **Profile Readmes**. For it to work, do the following:

1. Create a *special* GitHub repository with your username as repository name. My username is `Owanate` so my profile readme repository has the name `Owanate`.
1. Add a `README.md` to this repository.
1. Put some cool content about yourself (or anything you want) into `README.md`.

And that's about it. The `README.md` of your profile readme repository will be displayed on your profile page.
